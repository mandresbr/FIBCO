Ethereum blockchain based flight delay compensation

---
##### Blockchain technology is the queen of emerging technologies; the most recognized Blockchain implementation, Bitcoin, has become incredibly popular throughout the world. Blockchain offers so much more than being the base of cryptocurrency. With the Ethereum platform, the Blockchain concept goes further and focuses on the creation of decentralized applications (Dapps) based on smart contracts. ##### 

#### Solution ####

A flight delay compensation system which is unhackable or which cannot be tampered. Using blockchain based distributed networks to store and record policies which makes the process of compensation to be almost 99.9% secure as it is distributed among a cluster of networks and requires computing power of over 500 supercomputers to even get hold of the network which is currently impossible to achieve. In this work, a decentralized application based on Blockchain will be built with Ethereum's smart contracts to make up passengers in case of flight delays in the Colombian aviation context. The system has a user friendly interface where travelers can search their flight and pay for the policy that will compensate in case of the delay. 

## Security Aspect :lock:
We are using blockchain technology as the backbone of our product. Because of blockchain, the data canâ€™t be tampered or manipulated as it is distributed over the network. We used ganache which is a tool that collects a small percentage of test ether every time a person pays for a policy and we also used solidity smart contracts for ensure that the payout is done only when the flight is actually delayed.


## Technologies Used :computer:
* Ethereum
* Truffle
* Ganache
* Vue Js (Client side)
* Webpack
* Solidity
